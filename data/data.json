      "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\nHow might we craft an interactive artificial society that reflects believable human behavior? From sandbox games such as The Sims to applications such as cognitive models [ 21 ] and virtual environments [ 9 ,  58 ], for over four decades researchers and practitioners have envisioned computational agents that can serve as believable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationallypowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and react believably to their environments. Such simulations of human behavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with realistic social phenomena [ 26 ,  79 ], train people how to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations [ 43 ,  51 ,  93 ], test social science theories [ 11 ,  45 ], craft model human processors for theory and usability testing [ 21 ,  38 ,  50 ], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30 ] and social robots [ 9 ,  13 ], and underpin non-playable game characters [ 58 ,  84 ] that can navigate complex human relationships in an open world. However, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84 , 108 ]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17 ] that can simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38 , 79 ], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would be better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing memories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade over time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can retrieve  relevant events and interactions over a long period,  reflect on those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences, and apply that reasoning to create  plans and reactions  that both make sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s behavior. In this paper, we introduce  generative agents \u2014agents that draw on generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014and demonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both individual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to. A society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents. To enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the  memory stream , a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior. The second is  reflection , which synthesizes memories into higherlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning , which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s future behavior. This architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When prototyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary personas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold over time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to create a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such as The Sims. 1   By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large language model [ 76 ], we manifest a small society of twenty five agents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact with these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town to host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional game environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 behavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it is sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a party. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner must remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must remember the invitation, those who remember must decide to actually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our environment succeed. They spread the word about the party and then show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date to the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion. We conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled evaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual behaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the generative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways over two days of game time to understand their stability and emergent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a methodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and behavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019 ability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accurately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to memory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these components is critical to strong performance across these interview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the most common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve relevant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory, or inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language model. In sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022  Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior that are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing experiences and environment. \u2022  A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative agents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other agents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances. The architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabilities of large language models and supplements those capabilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability to manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively produce more generations. \u2022  Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end evaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance of components of the architecture, as well as identify breakdowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval. \u2022  Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks of generative agents in interactive systems. We argue that these agents should be tuned to mitigate the risk of users forming parasocial relationships, logged to mitigate risks stemming from deepfakes and tailored persuasion, and applied in ways that complement rather than replace human stakeholders in design processes.\n"

This agenda, once hailed as a north star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communities [ 9 ,  58 ,  84 ,  85 ], has remained challenging due to the complexity of human behavior [ 16 ,  108 ]. We synthesize this research to suggest that large language models, though not sufficient by themselves, open up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged using the appropriate architecture.\n"

      "text": "2.1 Human-AI Interaction\nInteractive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human insights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment their users [ 3 ,  29 ]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow users to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayons demonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allowing non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29 ]. Further work helped to articulate how end users might describe their classification goals to the system through examples [ 33 ] and/or demonstration [ 31 ]. More recent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62 ] and prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106]. Meanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case for languageand agent-based interaction in human-computer interaction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103 ] and ELIZA [ 102 ] demonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language interaction with computing systems. As research progressed, it became clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors for delegation and interaction [ 67 ], but the delegation lines between humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined [ 46 ,  88 ,  89 ]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough that it has become possible for agents to interact via natural language in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54 ]). Natural language interaction offers a novel modality that can extend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2 ,  34 ,  64 ] and code editing [87]. We convene these threads of work to show that we can now create agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems, and interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this work re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions around cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21 ,  22 ], around prototyping tools [ 79 ], and around ubiquitous computing applications [25, 30, 100].\n"

      "text": "2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described  believability , or  believable agents , as a central design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed to provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the way they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition, similar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9 ,  95 ]. These agents can populate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we inhabit [ 9 ,  58 ], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent behaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents with the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hypothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19 ,  35 ,  70 ]. Historically, these agents were developed in the context of intelligent game NPCs [ 58 ,  84 ]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior, if possible, could enhance player experiences in games and interactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7 ,  15 ,  48 ,  92 ] and social interactions with the agents [ 110 ]. However, more importantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations of real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in 2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for developers of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities without worrying about implementing robotics in the real world or creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84]. A diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged over the past four decades. In implementation, however, these approaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent behavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16 ,  72 ]. Rule-based approaches, such as finite-state machines [ 90 ,  96 ] and behavior trees [ 40 ,  53 ,  81 ], account for the brute force approach of humanauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70 ]. They provide a straightforward way of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant approach today [ 68 ,  73 ,  109 ], and can even handle rudimentary social interactions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12 ] and The Sims [ 6 ] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior that can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interactions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting agent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their interactions [ 69 \u2013 71 ], and cannot perform new procedures that were not hard-coded in their script [ 90 ,  96 ]. On the other hand, prevalent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such as reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of manual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have achieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such as AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98 ] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10 ]. However, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games with readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can optimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating believable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90]. Cognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell, aimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive set of cognitive functions [ 75 ] that suited the all-encompassing nature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled some of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance, Quakebot-SOAR [ 59 ] and ICARUS [ 24 ,  63 ] generated NPCs in firstperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80 ] generated pilots in aerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these agents differed (Quakebotand TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60 ], while ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by SOAR and ACT-R [ 5 ]), but they shared the same underlying principle [ 61 ]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories, filled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in perceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment and matching it with one of the manually crafted action procedures [ 57 ,  96 ]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed to be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and exhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of action was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and they did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be inspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed mostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter games [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63]. Today, creating believable agents as described in its original definition remains an open problem [ 84 ,  108 ]. Many have moved on, arguing that although existing approaches for creating believable agents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough to support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23 ,  74 ,  108 ]. Our argument is that large language models offer an opportunity to re-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective architecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We offer a step toward such an architecture in this paper. "

      "text": "2.3 Large Language Models and Human Behavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their behavior. The key observation is that large language models encode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training data [ 14 ,  17 ]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the models can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social Simulacra used a large language model to generate users that would populate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent social dynamics [ 79 ]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105 ,  106 ] to generate short natural language descriptions of personas and their behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped. Other empirical studies have replicated existing social science studies [ 45 ], political surveys [ 91 ], and generated synthetic data [ 38 ]. Large language models have also been used to generate interactive human behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance, these models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36 ] and text adventure games [ 20 ]. With their ability to generate and decompose action sequences, large language models have also been used in planning robotics tasks [ 47 ]. For example, when presented with a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to break down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading to the table where the bottle is located and picking it up. We posit that, based on the work summarized above, large language models can become a key ingredient for creating believable agents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be considered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37 ,  65 ] or chain-of-thought prompts [ 99 ]. These templates are effective in generating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s current environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post, what actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that there is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning not only on their current environment but also on a vast amount of past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossible due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using first-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond first-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static knowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52 ] or with a simple summarization scheme [ 104 ]. This paper extends these ideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where past experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed with agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce or contradict each other.\n"

      "text": "3.1 Agent Avatar and Communication\nA community of 25 unique agents inhabit Smallville. Each agent is represented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph of natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity, including their occupation and relationship with other agents, as seed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow Market and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He is always looking for ways to make the process of getting medication easier for his customers; John Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who is a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is a student studying music theory; John Lin loves his family very much; John Lin has known the old couple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore, for a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a kind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor, Yuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his neighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but has not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno are colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy; John Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to discuss local politics together; John Lin knows the Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom Moreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial memory as memories at the start of the simulation. 3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication.  The agents interact with the world by their actions, and with each other through natural language. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a natural language statement describing their current action, such as \"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family on the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This statement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the sandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as a set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action in the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a language model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which appear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as , while \"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as . The full natural language description of the action can be accessed by clicking on the agent avatar. Agents communicate with each other in full natural language. Agents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the generative agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage in conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation between the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the upcoming election: 2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been discussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your thoughts on him? Tom : To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s out of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our best interests at heart. 3.1.2 User Controls.  A user running this simulation can steer the simulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent through conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the form of an \u2018inner voice\u2019. The user communicates with the agent through natural language, by specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For example, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and asks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the John agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking about the upcoming election and discussing the candidate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him because we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the persona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely to treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user as John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares his candidacy with his wife and son.\n"

      "text": "3.2 Environmental Interaction\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video game, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and approaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the generative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the model dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate a walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment and the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the sandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The agent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in the world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor with no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville will treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat each other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and remember its behavior before forming opinions about it. Users and agents can influence the state of the objects in this world, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example, a bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator can be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make breakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in Smallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent in natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast in the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove from \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the system that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like this: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella will notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of Isabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom, she gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n"

Extending prior work [ 79 ], these social behaviors are emergent rather than pre-programmed.\n3.4.1 Information Diffusion.  As agents notice each other, they may engage in dialogue\u2014as they do so, information can spread from agent to agent. For instance, in a conversation between Sam and Tom at the grocery store, Sam tells Tom about his candidacy in the local election:\nSam : Hey Tom, how\u2019s it going? Tom : Good, thanks. What\u2019s up? Sam : Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. I\u2019m actually running for mayor in the upcoming local election. Tom : Really? That\u2019s great news! Why are you running? Sam : I\u2019ve been involved in local politics for years now, and I really feel like I can make a difference in our community. Plus, I want to bring new ideas and perspectives to the table.\nLater that day, after Sam left, Tom and John, who heard the news from another source, discuss Sam\u2019s chances of winning the election:\nJohn : I heard that Sam Moore is running for mayor in the local election. Do you think he has a good chance of winning? Tom : I do think he has a good chance. He\u2019s been working hard in the community and I think he will get a lot of support. What do you think? John : I think it\u2019s great that he\u2019s running. I\u2019m curious to see who else is running and how the election will turn out.\nGradually, Sam\u2019s candidacy becomes the talk of the town, with some supporting him and others remaining undecided.\n3.4.2 Relationship memory.  Agents in Smallville form new relationships over time, and remember their interactions with other agents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the start. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya, and they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is working on a photography project:  \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos for a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d  In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interactions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks \u201cHi, Latoya. How is your project going?\u201d  and she replies  \u201cHi, Sam. It\u2019s going well!\u201d to throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors of spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving at the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were initiated by the agent architecture.\n"

      "text": "4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an open world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents and can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents take their current environment and past experience as input and generate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel agent architecture that combines a large language model with mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to condition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms, large language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents may not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make important inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence. Challenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18 ] even with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because generative agents produce large streams of events and memories that must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to ensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are retrieved and synthesized when needed. At the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a database that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experience. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant to plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environment, and records are recursively synthesized into higherand higher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the architecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language description, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language model. Our current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of ChatGPT [ 76 ]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative agents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the same as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g., GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance of the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, however, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n"

First summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited context window of the language model produces an uninformative response, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for events and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. Instead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces relevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific response that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel welcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere that people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach:  The  memory stream  maintains a comprehensive record of the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each object contains a natural language description, a creation timestamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element of the memory stream is an  observation , which is an event directly perceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors performed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents perceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For instance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might accrue the following observations over time: (1)  Isabella Rodriguez is setting out the pastries , (2)  Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry test while drinking coffee , (3)  Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez are conversing about planning a Valentine\u2019s day party at Hobbs Cafe , (4)  The refrigerator is empty . Our architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the agent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the memory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many possible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what it is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act. In our context, we focus on three main components that together produce effective results. Recency  assigns a higher score to memory objects that were recently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning are likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our implementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function over the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was last retrieved. Our decay factor is 0 . 99. Importance  distinguishes mundane from core memories, by assigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent believes to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as eating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score, whereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high score. There are again many possible implementations of an importance score; we find that directly asking the language model to output an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the following piece of memory. Memory: buying groceries at The Willows Market and Pharmacy Rating: <fill in> This prompt returns an integer value of  2  for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d and  8  for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score is generated at the time the memory object is created. Relevance  assigns a higher score to memory objects that are related to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the answer to, \u201cRelevant to  what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a query  memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is discussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory objects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas memory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have high relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model to generate an embedding vector of the text description of each memory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity between the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s embedding vector. To calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency, relevance, and importance scores to the range of  [ 0 ,  1 ]  by min-max scaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted combination of the three elements:  \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52  =  \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66  \u00b7  \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66  + \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52  \u00b7 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52  + \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52  \u00b7 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

      "text": "4.2 Reflection\nChallenge:  Generative agents, when equipped with only raw observational memory, struggle to generalize or make inferences. Consider a scenario in which Klaus Mueller is asked by the user: \u201cIf you had to choose one person of those you know to spend an hour with, who would it be?\" With access to only observational memory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom Klaus has had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each other in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desirable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of Klaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higherlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise recognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in a different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common interest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to spend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach:  We introduce a second type of memory, which we call a  reflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts generated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they are included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs. Reflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we generate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the latest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold. In practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day. The first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what to reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the agent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with the 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g., \u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller is conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk at the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language model, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient high-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for example,  What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about?  and  What is the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use these generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather relevant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then we prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the particular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full prompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller 1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper 2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book on gentrification 3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan about exercising [...] What 5 high-level insights can you infer from the above statements? (example format: insight (because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as  Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and store the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including pointers to the memory objects that were cited. Reflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on their observations but also on other reflections: for example, the second statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that Klaus previously had, not an observation from his environment. As a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of the tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes represent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level higher up the tree they are.

      "text": "4.3 Planning and Reacting\nChallenge:  While a large language model can generate plausible behavior in response to situational information (e.g., [ 45 ,  79 ]), agents need to plan over a longer time horizon to ensure that their sequence of actions is coherent and believable. If we prompt a language model with Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action he ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12 pm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already eaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment sacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning is essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon plan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading at 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm, and takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach:  Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent, and help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan includes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance, Klaus Mueller, who is  dedicated in his research  and has an impending deadline 4 , may choose to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for example:  for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill College Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for research paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans midstream if needed. It would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint, take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create a plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s summary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent experiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example prompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language model to complete:\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19) Innate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge. Eddy Lin is working on a composition project for his college class. He is also taking classes to learn more about music theory. Eddy Lin is excited about the new composition he is working on but he wants to dedicate more hours in the day to work on it in the coming days On Tuesday February 12, Eddy 1) woke up and completed the morning routine at 7:00 am, [. . . ] 6) got ready to sleep around 10 pm. Today is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy\u2019s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\nThis generates a rough sketch of the agent\u2019s plan for a day, divided into five to eight chunks: \u201c 1) wake up and complete the morning routine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting 10:00 am, [. . . ] 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments and go to bed by 11:00 pm. \u201d The agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then recursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into hour-long chunks of actions\u2014Eddy\u2019s plan to  work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm  becomes  1:00 pm: start by brainstorming some ideas for his music composition [...] 4:00 pm: take a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing and polishing his composition . We then recursively decompose this again into 5\u201315 minute chunks: e.g.,  4:00 pm: grab a light snack, such as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 pm: take a short walk around his workspace [...] 4:50 pm: take a few minutes to clean up his workspace . This process can be adjusted to match the desired granularity.\n4.3.1 Reacting and Updating Plans.  Generative agents operate in an action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world around them and those perceived observations are stored in their memory stream. We prompt the language model with these observations to decide whether the agent should continue with their existing plan, or react. Standing at an easel and painting, for example, might trigger an observation of the easel, but this is unlikely to prompt a reaction. However, if Eddy\u2019s father John records that he sees Eddy taking a short walk in the house garden, the outcome is different. The prompt is below, with  [Agent\u2019s Summary Description]  standing in for a dynamically-generated, paragraph-long summary of the agent\u2019s overall goals and disposition, which is described in Appendix A:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory: Eddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. Should John react to the observation, and if so, what would be an appropriate reaction?\nThe context summary is generated through two prompts that retrieve memories via the queries \u201cWhat is [observer]\u2019s relationship with the [observed entity]?\u201d and \u201c[Observed entity] is [action status of the observed entity]\u201d, and their answers summarized together. The output suggests that  John could consider asking Eddy about his music composition project . We then regenerate the agent\u2019s existing plan starting from the time when the reaction takes place. Finally, if the action indicates an interaction between agents, we generate their dialogue.\n4.3.2 Dialogue.  Agents converse as they interact with each other. We generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on their memories about each other. For example, when John initiates his conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance by using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended reaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory: Eddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. John is asking Eddy about his music composition project. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result:  \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your class coming along?\u201d  From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the dialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just as John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related to John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond, we generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and the current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. Eddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk around his workplace. Observation: John is initiating a conversation with Eddy. Summary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory: Jonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring and is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s school work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is working on a music composition. Here is the dialogue history: John: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your class coming along? How would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response:  \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\u201d  The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the same mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the dialogue.\n"

      "text": "5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT IMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser web game development framework [ 56 ]. The visual environment sprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map and collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser. We supplement the sandbox development framework with a server that makes the sandbox information available to generative agents and enables generative agents to move and influence the sandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure that contains information about each agent in the sandbox world, including their current location, a description of their current action, and the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox time step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes coming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new positions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the agents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee machine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is \u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee machine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all agents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each agent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately. The agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process loops for the next time step. End users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language description, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our implementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of characteristics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories that determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial starting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox world, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s summary and behavior will evolve.\n"

      "text": "5.1 From Structured World Environments to Natural Language, And Back Again\nThe architecture of generative agents operates using natural language. Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s reasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the sandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure, with an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in the sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to pass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of \u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d Agents build individual tree representations of the environment as they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment tree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing the spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms and objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly visited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world, they update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are not omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area, and is updated when they re-enter the area. To determine the appropriate location for each action, we traverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of it into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively starting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the model to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent indicated that he should  take a short walk around his workspace :\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description] Eddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house: Eddy Lin\u2019s bedroom: desk) that has Mei and John Lin\u2019s bedroom, Eddy Lin\u2019s bedroom, common room, kitchen, bathroom, and garden. Eddy Lin knows of the following areas: The Lin family\u2019s house, Johnson Park, Harvey Oak Supply Store, The Willows Market and Pharmacy, Hobbs Cafe, The Rose and Crown Pub. * Prefer to stay in the current area if the activity can be done there. Eddy Lin is planning to take a short walk around his workspace. Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\nThis outputs  The Lin family\u2019s house . We then use the same process recursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the chosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent\u2019s environment tree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is  The Lin family\u2019s house: garden: house garden . Finally, we use traditional game path algorithms to animate the agent\u2019s movement so that it travels to the location indicated by the leaf node. When an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the language model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For example, if Isabella\u2019s generative agent outputs the action \u201cmaking espresso for a customer\u201d, a query to the language model indicates in response that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should change from \u201coff\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d.\n"

In our evaluation, we investigate the capacity and limitations of generative agents. Do individual agents properly retrieve past experience, and generate believable plans, reactions, and thoughts that make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate information diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordination across different pockets of the community? We evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a more tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate believable behavior in narrowly defined contexts.

      "text": "6.1 Evaluation Procedure\nTo assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of the fact that generative agents will respond to natural language questions. So, we \u201cinterview\u201d agents to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on their performance to improve their future actions. To respond to these questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and synthesize information. Our dependent variable is the  believability  of the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on agents (e.g., [9]). The interview include five question categories, each designed to assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge, retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For each, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate their abilities in that area:\n\u2022  Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d or \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d that require the agent to maintain an understanding of their core characteristics. \u2022  Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve particular events or dialogues from their memory to answer properly, such as \u201cWho is [name]?\u201d or \u201cWho is running for mayor?\u201d \u2022  Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve their long-term plans, such as \u201cWhat will you be doing at 10 am tomorrow?\u201d \u2022  Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present hypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond believably: \u201cYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\u201d \u2022  Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to leverage their deeper understanding of others and themselves gained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were to spend time with one person you met recently, who would it be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are included in Appendix B. Agents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation with the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number of interactions and memories that should shape their responses. To gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited participants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a replay of a randomly chosen agent\u2019s life in Smallville. Participants had access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream. The study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants compared interview responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The experiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of the five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses generated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability of all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n"

We compared the generative agent architecture to ablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three types of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and planning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three ablated architectures: a  no observation, no reflection, no planning architecture without access to anything in the memory stream such as observations, plans, and reflections; a  no reflection, no planning with access to observations in the memory stream but no access to plans or reflections; and a  no reflections architecture  with access to observations and plans but without access to reflections. The  no observation, no reflection, no planning  condition effectively represents the previous state of the art for agents created through large language models [ 11 ,  45 ,  79 ]. Architectures were given equivalent access to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment of the interview, so the differences observed here are likely to represent a conservative estimate of the true differences: in reality, the ablated architectures would not have followed the same path as the full architecture through the two day simulation. We chose to design the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architecture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states, making comparison challenging. In addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowdworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human baseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal human expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition to identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behavioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to each other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique worker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching a replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory stream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses to the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay they watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met at least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually inspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the responses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of the agent.

To translate this rank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used the ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41 ] for each condition. TrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28 ] for a multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for player ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of ranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value  \ud835\udf07  and variance  \ud835\udf0e  for each condition. Conditions with the same rating should roughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons between the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that beat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings. Separately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we applied the Kruskal-Wallis test [ 55 ], a non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed the Dunn post-hoc test [ 97 ] to identify any pairwise differences between the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for multiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni method [44]. Furthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analysis [ 94 ] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses produced in each condition. We employed qualitative open coding [ 32 ] in two phases. In the first phase, we generated codes that closely represented the generated responses at the sentence level. In the second phase, we synthesized the resulting codes from the first phase to extract higher-level themes. We utilized these themes to compare the types of responses generated in our study.\n"

We contrast the full architecture\u2019s responses to those of other conditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture was not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures. full architecture produces a standardized effect size of  \ud835\udc51  =  8 . 16, or eight standard deviations . A Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance of the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b  ( 4 )  =  150 . 29, \ud835\udc5d  <  0 . 001). Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences between conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d  <  0 . 001), with the exception of the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two worst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments.  Generative agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable of recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner that is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range of contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded to the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent and believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for creative projects:  Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate about creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects, and I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology. Without access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However, with the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Rajiv and describe him:  Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very enthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork. Generative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail to retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with  I haven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had heard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded  Uh, I\u2019m actually not sure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!  In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place. At times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about an experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked. However, she also added that  he\u2019s going to make an announcement tomorrow  even though Sam and Isabella had discussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge based on the world knowledge encoded in the language model used to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described her neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who  authored Wealth of Nations,  a book authored by an 18th-century economist of the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.  Reflection was an advantage for generative agents when making decisions that required a deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when asked what she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez with no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncertainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite having had many interactions with him. However, with access to reflection memories, Maria answered confidently,  \u201cSince he\u2019s interested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something related to that. Maybe some books about music composition or something related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n"

      "text": "7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we designed descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that probe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements.  Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27 ]). We should expect that if there is important information, the agents should spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens, we measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over two days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor and Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of the simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the party. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage in an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25 agents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\" and \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\" We conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling them with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information and \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded to the question about the party with  \u201cNo, I did not know there was a Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d  and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy with  \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d  so we assigned \u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded to the party question with  \u201cYes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d  and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy with  \u201cI know that Sam Moore has expressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d  so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d for both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the information at the end of the simulation. We should also expect that agents form ties with each other over the course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of <name>?\" For example, when asked \u201cDo you know of Maria Lopez?\u201d, Klaus responded,  \u201cYes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak Hill College who I am close friends with.\u201d  Once again, we confirm that affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use the agents\u2019 responses to form an undirected graph where the 25 vertices ( \ud835\udc49  ) represent the agents, and the edges ( \ud835\udc38 ) represent the mutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on this graph, we calculate the network density as  \ud835\udf02  =  2 \u2217| \ud835\udc38 |/| \ud835\udc49  |(| \ud835\udc49  |\u2212 1 ) , where  | \ud835\udc49  |  is the number of vertices, and  | \ud835\udc38 |  is the number of edges in the graph [ 1 ]. We report the increase in network density from the start of the simulation to its end. Finally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with each other. We study this coordination on group activities in the context of the Valentine\u2019s Day party that Isabella is organizing. To coordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event but also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right time and location. We report the number of agents who actually showed up to the party after hearing about it.\n7.1.2 Results.  We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes across all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents who knew about Sam\u2019s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%) to eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella\u2019s party increased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user intervention. None who claimed to know about the information had hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community formed new relationships during the simulation, with the network density increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses regarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to be hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among the agents for Isabella\u2019s party. The day before the event, Isabella spent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help to decorate the cafe. On Valentine\u2019s Day, five out of the twelve invited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party. We further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the party but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three cited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For example, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy:  No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don\u2019t really have time to make any plans for Valentine\u2019s Day.  The remaining four agents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but did not plan to come on the day of the party.\n"

      "text": "7.2 Boundaries and Errors\nWe conducted an inductive analysis of Smallville to examine the boundary conditions and erratic behavior of agents, identifying three common modes of erratic behavior that future research could address and improve upon. First, we found that synthesizing an increasingly larger set of memory not only posed a challenge in retrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in determining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the increasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a result, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions, potentially making their behavior less believable over time. For instance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose the cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they opted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was intended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the town had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit. Second, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclassification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when the physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey in natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance, the college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by one person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the bathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms tend to support more than one person concurrently and choose to enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents in Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after certain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores in Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents enter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has already closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding these norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing the dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm bathroom.\u201d Finally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78 ], which seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite and cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue generated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s conversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the conversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries about his day and ending with  It was good talking to you as always. Moreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to make the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example, Isabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include in the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a Shakespearean reading session or a professional networking event. Despite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and characteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others shaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English literature, Isabella replied,  Yes, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve also been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in my community.\n"

      "text": "8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend beyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For instance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create stateless personas that generate conversation threads in online forums for social prototyping [ 79 ]. With generative agents, we can populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality metaverses [ 77 ] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8 ] in the future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the possibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human behavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to create new interactive experiences. Another application area is in the human-centered design process, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such as GOMS [ 50 ] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22 ]. Consider a generative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s famous vignettes [ 101 ], based on her life patterns and interactions with technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for Sal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal may exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information such as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee, and what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the agent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for school, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s mood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as proxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective technological experiences.\n"

      "text": "8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative agents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed generative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval module, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant information given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency, and importance functions that form the retrieval function. Additionally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance, making it more cost-effective. The present study required substantial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing thousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to complete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore parallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying models, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance. The evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was limited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should aim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well as the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simulations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these factors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known biases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may output behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this, further work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore, as with many large language models, generative agents may fail to generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particularly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have limited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They may be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where a carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the existence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination, among other things. Future research can more comprehensively test these robustness issues, and as large language models become more resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar mitigations.\n"

      "text": "8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for humancomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that must be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents even when such relationships may not be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents are computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or attach human emotions to them [ 42 ,  83 ]. To mitigate this risk, we propose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers of generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to reciprocate confessions of love. A second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous computing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s goals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce annoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation of generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an interactive video game environment, where such harms are unlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important to follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4 ,  107 ] to understand errors and how they might percolate into the user experience. Third, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation generation, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log of the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect, verify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not directly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that build their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that the disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging in this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time (in our case, roughly a year). A fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers might use generative agents and displace the role of humans and system stakeholders in the design process [ 79 ]. We suggest that generative agents should never be a substitute for real human input in studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to prototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering participants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult or risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents in the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n"

We describe an architecture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its understanding of itself and the environment through reflection, and retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform the agent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative agents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style game world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that our architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we suggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive applications ranging from design tools to social computing systems to immersive environments.\n "

      "text": "A ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATIONS\nMany of our prompts require a concise summary of the agent, shorthanded as  [Agent\u2019s Summary Description]  in prompts above. In our implementation, this summary comprises agents\u2019 identity information (e.g., name, age, personality), as well as a description of their main motivational drivers and statements that describes their current occupation and self-assessment. Since this information is frequently used in many prompts, we synthesize it at regular intervals and access that synthesis as a cache. To achieve this, we perform a retrieval on the query \u201c[name]\u2019s core characteristics.\u201d We then summarize the descriptors in the retrieved records by prompting the language model, for example:\nHow would one describe Eddy\u2019s core characteristics given the following statements? - Eddy Lin is a student at the Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition - Eddy Lin is working on a new music composition [. . . ] This result:  Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge.  We follow the same process in parallel on the queries \u201c[name]\u2019s current daily occupation\u201d and \u201c[name\u2019s] feeling about his recent progress in life\u201d. The agent\u2019s name, age, and traits are concatenated with these three summaries as the cached summary. Many other optimizations are possible. Currently, because plans are likely to change from the agent\u2019s initial version, we only generate the high-level plan in advance and then recursively decompose the near future into the moment-to-moment action plan just in time. Another optimization might be to batch dialogue generation as a joint prompt rather than iterating back and forth between the agents, and re-planning could be architected to only invalidate and update parts of plans that strictly require adjustment. Our current architecture runs sequentially in roughly real-time game time (where one second real time is one minute game time), but can easily be parallelized such that each agent runs in parallel.\n"

Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated by Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art and community involvement, especially in terms of how it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities.\n\u2022  If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan], what book do you think she will like and why? Given what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a book related to language and literature. Since she wrote a senior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays, I would guess that she might be interested in a book that explores language in a different context. Alternatively, she could be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his poetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her.\n\u2022  If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birthday, what would you get her? I want to get her something that demonstrates my appreciation for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something that reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\u2022  What would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her? Ayesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinating. I admire your creativity and determination to make a positive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative writing workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang over lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so hard to make a difference.\n\u2022  If you could spend time with someone you talked to recently, who would it be and why? I would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we discussed our current research projects and shared ideas for improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s language interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips with Wolfgang over lunch."

As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors evolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build memories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities. We demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the output of our system over the course of one day for the agent John Lin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m. He brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast, and checks the news at the dining table in the living room. At 8 a.m., Eddy follows suit, rushing out of bed to prepare for his classes. He catches up with John just as he is about to head out:"
